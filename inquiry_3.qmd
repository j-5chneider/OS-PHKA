### `r fontawesome::fa("magnifying-glass")` Explore the use of ATI in articles
  
There are several **examples** that use ATI listed on its website: [qdr.syr.edu/ati/ati-models](https://qdr.syr.edu/ati/ati-models)\

* Select one or two of the articles from the table and open the annotated version of the article (link in column "ATI Link").
* What is your first impression on the intersubjective comprehensibility? Does ATI improve your understanding of the author's reasoning?
* How did different authors use ATI in their articles?

### `r fontawesome::fa("magnifying-glass")` Let's try out hypothes.is!
For exploration purposes, we'll try to **annotate an article** of someone else.

* Go to ([web.hypothes.is/start](https://web.hypothes.is/start/)) and follow the steps there:
  - Make an account
  - Install the Chrome-extension or save the Firefox/Safari bookmarklet
* Now let's annotate an article:
  - Head to this paper [doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2023.1166018](https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2023.1166018)
  - Activate hypothes.is (will show on the very right of your screen)
  - Explore how you can annotate (text, pictures, links, ...)
