Research data is open, if

* **anyone**
* can **readily access** the data
* at no more than a **reasonable reproduction cost** (i.e., internet connection)

There may be perfectly good reasons not to share data or to share them only with a very specific group. Such as the protection of vulnerable or marginalized individuals or due to ministry regulations.\

This is why the general notion when sharing data is:  
*"As open as possible as closed as necessary"*
