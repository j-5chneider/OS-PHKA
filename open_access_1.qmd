# What it is

Open access refers to **free access** to digital scientific publications via the internet that is not hindered by payment barriers or registration hurdles.\

The rights of use for open access publications are regulated transparently via so-called free licenses (e.g. Creative Commons licenses).\

The authors' copyrights, such as the protection of intellectual property or the right to quote, are also protected in open access publications in accordance with the Copyright Act.\

In some (mostly closed-access) journals, the copyright is transferred to the journals and **the authors retain very few rights**. For example, if they want to use a graphic from the paper in a presentation, they would (theoretically) first have to request the right of use from the journal.
